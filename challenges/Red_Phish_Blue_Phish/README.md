# Red_Phish_Blue_Phish
*You are to conduct a phishing excercise against our client, Pyrch Data.*

We've identified the Marketing Director, Sarah Williams (swilliams@pyrchdata.com), as a user susceptible to phishing.*

*Are you able to successfully phish her? Remember your OSINT ;)*

***NOTE: The port that becomes accessible upon challenge deployment is an SMTP server. Please use this for sending any phishing emails.***

***You will not receive an email/human response as the mail infrastructure for this challenge is emulated.***


## Solution
1. Google the domain-name, find the names of the employees
2. Craft an email (using email-commands)
3. Send from their cyber-security-guy, get the flag


## Flag
**Flag:** `flag{54c6ec05ca19565754351b7fcf9c03b2}`
