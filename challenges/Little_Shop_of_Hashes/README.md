*In the packet, secrets lie,*
*Whispers of data pass by,*
*Encrypted shadows creep,*
*While the watchful eyes peep.*

*Are you able to unravel the attack chain? The first question is:*


## Part 1
*What is the name of the service that the attacker ran and stopped, which dumped hashes on the first compromised host?*

### Solution
1. <++>
2. `<++>`
3. `./solve.sh`

### Flag
**Flag:** `<++>`


## Part 2
*What lateral movement technique did the threat actor use to move to the other machine?*

### Solution
1. <++>
2. `<++>`
3. `./solve.sh`

### Flag
**Flag:** `<++>`


## Part 3
*What is the full path of the binary that the threat actor used to access the privileges of a different user with explicit credentials?*

### Solution
1. <++>
2. `<++>`
3. `./solve.sh`

### Flag
**Flag:** `<++>`


## Part 4
*How many accounts were compromised by the threat actor?*

### Solution
1. <++>
2. `<++>`
3. `./solve.sh`

### Flag
**Flag:** `<++>`


## Part 5
*What is the full path of the binary that was used to attempt a callback to the threat actor's machine?*

### Solution
